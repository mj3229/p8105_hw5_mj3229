## Problem 1

Function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws “birthdays” for
each person; checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group;
and returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on the result.

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(bdays))
}
```

**Run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50**

``` r
sim_results =
  tibble(group_size = 2:50) %>%
  mutate(
    sim_out = map(group_size, ~ rerun(10000, bday_sim(.x))),
    sim_out = map(sim_out, unlist),
    prob = map_dbl(sim_out, mean)
  )
```

**Plot if Group size vs Probability of Shared Birthday**

``` r
sim_results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Shared Birthday vs Group Size",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Based off the line plot, the larger the group size, the higher the
probability of a shared birthday. For example, with a group size of 20
there is approximately 0.38 probability of a shared birthday but for 50
people group size, almost 1.00 probability indicating large likeliness
of a shared birthday within a setting.

## Problem 2

``` r
sim_ttest = function(mu, n = 30, sd = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sd)
  )
  
  test_res = t.test(sim_data$x, mu = 0) %>%
    broom::tidy()
  
  tibble(
    mu_hat = pull(test_res, estimate),
    p_value = pull(test_res, p.value)
  )
}
```

**Repeat the above for 𝜇={1,2,3,4,5,6}**

``` r
sim_res =
  expand_grid(
    true_mu = 0:6,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    out = map(true_mu, ~ sim_ttest(mu = .x))
  ) %>%
  unnest(out)
```

**Plot of Power of Test vs True value of μ**

``` r
sim_res %>%
  mutate(reject = p_value < 0.05) %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(prob_reject = mean(reject)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = prob_reject)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "True Mean (μ)",
    y = "Power (Proportion of Null Rejections)",
    title = "Association between Effect Size and Power"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mj3229_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

As the true mean increases, the power (proportion of null rejections)
increases as well. As the true mean increases from 0-6 the power of the
one-sample t-test increases significantly. Specifically from μ ≥ 3,
power accelerates quickly and plateaus at μ =5 and 6 as power is nearly
1.

**Plot Average Estimate of 𝜇̂ vs True Value of 𝜇**

``` r
all_sim_plot =
  sim_res %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(mean_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat)) %>%
  mutate(type = "all")


reject_sim_plot =
  sim_res %>%
  filter(p_value < 0.05) %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(mean_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat)) %>%
  mutate(type = "reject")

combined_mu =
  bind_rows(all_sim_plot, reject_sim_plot)
```

**Combined Plots**

``` r
combined_mu %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = mean_mu_hat, color = type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "True Mean (μ)",
    y = "Average Estimated μ̂",
    color = "Group",
    title = "Average μ̂ for All Samples vs Rejected Samples"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mj3229_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

The average 𝜇^ across all samples is approximately equal to the true
𝜇when 4 and greater. However, when looking at rejected null value
samples, 𝜇^ is inflated for small true mean values (3 and less). This
happens because rejection of the null requires observing a sample mean
that is far from 0 so extreme samples end of rejected. As a result, it
means that rejected samples are not usually representative of all the
possible samples and 𝜇^ average increases also increasing power.
Eventually the rejected average converges with the overall averagae and
both align with the true 𝜇.
